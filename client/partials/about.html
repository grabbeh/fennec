		<p>Fennec helps you to liberate your trade mark portfolios from opaque spreadsheets. You can then view details
		of your portfolio wherever you may be with an internet connection and get a handle on the important parts of your 
		portfolio.</p>
		
		<p>In addition to visualisation and analysis tools, Fennec also provides management tools so you can use Fennec to act as a 
		central information store for your portfolio, and also set reminders so you can prepare in good time for upcoming renewals.</p>
		<p>For acquirers of companies holding portfolios, Fennec also allows you to quickly get a handle on the portfolio 
		including analysis of the quality, geographical spread and overall health of the portfolio.</p>
		<p>If you're interested in building further functionality yourself, your data can be accessed via an API rather than by
		the graphical interface used on this site. This allows you to grab just the data about your portfolio and manipulate/display it
		as you desire.</p>
		<p>Fennec came about mainly as a result of my own frustrations with my employer's trade mark portfolio which previously 
		based in an Excel spreadsheet. The first bit of functionality that I created was to visualise the extent of our portfolio
		on a world map and since that point it has been built into a product which has a variety of uses.</p>
		<p>I'm still working on the product and new features so if you have any suggestions, please get in touch.</p>
